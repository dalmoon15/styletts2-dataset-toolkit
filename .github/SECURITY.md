## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated:**
   ```powershell
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Use virtual environments** to isolate dependencies

3. **Don't commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, etc.)

4. **Review code** before running scripts from untrusted sources

5. **Keep Python updated** to the latest supported version

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Review dependencies** before adding new packages
3. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
4. **Validate user input** in scripts
5. **Follow secure coding practices**

## Known Security Considerations

### This Project

- **No network services** exposed by default
- **Local processing only** - no data sent to external servers
- **User-provided audio files** - ensure you have rights to process them
- **GPU access** - requires appropriate system permissions

### Dependencies

This project uses several third-party libraries. We rely on:
- **PyTorch** for GPU acceleration
- **Demucs** for audio separation
- **StyleTTS2** for text-to-speech
- **Gradio** for web interfaces

Please review the security policies of these dependencies:
- [PyTorch Security](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/security.html)
- [Gradio Security](https://www.gradio.app/guides/security)

## Disclosure Policy

- Security vulnerabilities will be disclosed after a fix is available
- We will credit security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities
- Public disclosure will be coordinated with the reporter

---

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1)
- Documented in release notes
- Tagged with security labels on GitHub
